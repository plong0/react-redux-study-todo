# React + Redux "Todo List" Study

This is a simple "Todo List" implementation for my study of React + Redux.

## Project Setup

* bootstrapped using standard [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) utility
* SCSS support added as described in ["Adding a CSS Preprocessor"](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc)
* project structure inspired by ["A Better File Structure For React/Redux Applications"](https://marmelab.com/blog/2015/12/17/react-directory-structure.html) by Fran√ßois Zaninotto
* code style based on [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
* testing setup uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) as described in ["Testing Components"](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#testing-components)
